# üõª UGV Control Board

A custom-designed control board for an **Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV)**, created in Altium Designer. It features two STM32 microcontrollers, robust I/O protection, flexible communication options (USB, UART, Bluetooth), and smart power input selection via an automatic switchover circuit.

## üöÄ Overview

This board acts as the central brain of a UGV, handling sensor input, encoder feedback, Bluetooth or wired communication with a host, and coordination between subsystems.

Key interfaces include:
- USB-C (via CH340) for UART comms + power
- UART header for optional debug/programming
- Bluetooth UART header for wireless control
- USB-B for encoder input
- DC jack for primary power
- Automatic switchover logic between USB-C and DC jack
